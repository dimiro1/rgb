# RGB - Game Boy Emulator

A Game Boy emulator written in Rust, based on my original [GameBoyCPP](https://github.com/dimiro1/GameBoyCPP) implementation.

The main goal is to get familiar with Rust and WebAssembly. The frontend will be WebAssembly only.

## Status

This is a work in progress. I have no idea if I'm going to finish it.
